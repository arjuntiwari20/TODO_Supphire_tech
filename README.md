# TODO_Supphire_tech
Todo app backend using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. Supports create, read, update, and soft delete (mark as deleted without removing from DB). Soft delete hides todos from dashboard but keeps data safe. Includes timestamps and RESTful APIs for full CRUD operations. Easy to extend!
